# Introduction to Machine Learning Applications
 A very brief explanation of what is machine learning.
* Supervised,Unsupervised and Reinforcement Machine Learning Previous Post
* Applications using machine learning we can learn from.
* Importance of machine learning in solving real-world problems.

### Problem Being Solved:

* The importance of early diagnosis in diseases like cancer, heart disease or diabetes.

* Problems with typical diagnostic approaches:slow, expensive and possibly erroneous.

### Type of Machine Learnings Used:

* Supervised Learning: Train models on labeled patient record datasets that capture features related to early signs of a disease.

* Impact of the Solution:

* Increased efficacy: Superior diagnostic accuracy.

* Early Diagnosis: Helps catch up with treatment at the right time, which leads to better patient outcomes.

* Saves Cost: Less dependence of expensive invasive procedures.

### Problem Being Solved:

* The challenge of targeting the right audience with personalized marketing efforts.
* Limitations of traditional broad segmentation methods.

### Type of Machine Learning Used:

* Unsupervised Learning: Models segment customers based on behavior, preferences, and demographics.

### Impact of the Solution:

* Personalized Marketing: More accurate targeting leading to better engagement.
* Increased Conversion Rates: Higher likelihood of converting leads to customers.
* Improved Customer Retention: Strengthened customer loyalty through personalized interactions.

### Problem Being Solved:

* Financial fraud is costing banks and other financial institutions.

* Traditional rule-based systems cannot catch evolving fraud patterns

### Type of Machine Learning Used:

* Unsupervised - (e.g., models review tons of transaction data to find outliers that may be fraud).

### Impact of the Solution:

* Live Detection: Detecting suspicious transactions in real time.

* Adaptive: Constant learning never let the fraud patterns end.

* Reduction in Fraud: Significant reduction in fraudulent activities, saving billions.
